                <p>During 1842–1849, Ada Lovelace translated the memoir of Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea about Charles Babbage's newest proposed machine: the Analytical Engine; she supplemented the memoir with notes that specified in detail a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the engine, recognized by most of historians as the world's first published computer program.[3]

                    The first computer codes were specialized for their applications: e.g., Alonzo Church was able to express the lambda calculus in a formulaic way and the Turing machine was an abstraction of the operation of a tape-marking machine.
                    
                    Jacquard Looms and Charles Babbage's Difference Engine both had simple languages for describing the actions that these machines should perform hence they were the creators of the first programming language.</p>

                <p>In the 1940s, the first recognizably modern electrically powered computers were created. The limited speed and memory capacity forced programmers to write hand-tuned assembly language programs. It was eventually realized that programming in assembly language required a great deal of intellectual effort.

                    An early proposal for a high-level programming language was Plankalkül, developed by Konrad Zuse for his Z1 computer between 1943 and 1945 but not implemented at the time.[4]
                    
                    The first functioning programming languages designed to communicate instructions to a computer were written in the early 1950s. John Mauchly's Short Code, proposed in 1949, was one of the first high-level languages ever developed for an electronic computer.

                <div class="h-primary">Establishing fundamental paradigms</div>
                <p>The period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s brought a major flowering of programming languages. Most of the major language paradigms now in use were invented in this period:
                  Speakeasy, developed in 1964 at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) by Stanley Cohen, is an OOPS (object-oriented programming system, much like the later MATLAB, IDL and Mathematica) numerical package. Speakeasy has a clear Fortran foundation syntax. It first addressed efficient physics computation internally at ANL, was modified for research use (as "Modeleasy") </p>

                <p>
                    
                    The 1980s were years of relative consolidation in imperative languages. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decade. C++ combined object-oriented and systems programming. The United States government standardized Ada, a systems programming language intended for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called fifth-generation programming languages that incorporated logic programming constructs. The functional languages community moved to standardize ML and Lisp. Research in Miranda, a functional language with lazy evaluation, began to take hold in this decade.

                    The rapid growth of the Internet in the mid-1990s was the next major historic event in programming languages. By opening up a radically new platform for computer systems, the Internet created an opportunity for new languages to be adopted. In particular, the JavaScript programming language rose to popularity because of its early integration with the Netscape Navigator web browser. Various other scripting languages achieved widespread use in developing customized applications for web servers such as PHP. The 1990s saw no fundamental novelty in imperative languages, but much recombination and maturation of old ideas. This era began the spread of functional languages. A big driving philosophy was programmer productivity. Many "rapid application development" (RAD) languages emerged, which usually came with an IDE, garbage collection, and were descendants of older languages.

                <p>
                    Programming language evolution continues, in both industry and research. Some of the recent trends have included:


                    D Programming Language
                    
                    Groovy
                    
                    PowerShell
                    
                    Rust
                    
                    Scratch
                    Increasing support for functional programming in mainstream languages used commercially, including pure functional programming for making code easier to reason about and easier to parallelise (at both micro- and macro- levels)
                    Constructs to support concurrent and distributed programming.
                    Mechanisms for adding security and reliability verification to the language: extended static checking, dependent typing, information flow control, static thread safety.
                    Alternative mechanisms for composability and modularity: mixins, traits, typeclasses, delegates, aspects.
                    Component-oriented software development.
